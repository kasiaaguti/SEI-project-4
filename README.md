# Software Engineering Immersive: Project 4
This was the second project during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course (Week 12).
​
## Timeframe & Team
​
1 week, solo
​
## Built With
* PostgreSQL
* Python
* Insomnia
* React
* Axios
* Webpack
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bulma
* Heroku

## Deployment
​
This website is deployed on Heroku and it can be found here: https://powerengineering.herokuapp.com/

## Description

It is a hub for Engineering Industry in Poland. It has features similar to LinkedIn where login users can create profiles to connect with each other and with companies.
I used Mapbox to show the locations of all companies listed on the website. As Mapbox doesn’t use addresses, but only geographical coordinates I added latitude and longitude for all companies while creating a seed file. It wouldn’t be user friendly to  ask our users to do the same when adding their companies, so I used mapbox function which allows to convert new addresses into geographic coordinates.
Thanks to newsapi.org public API this website can provide newest sector related information.
The most rewarding part of this exercise was to see again how quickly React allows to render my database

## Challenges

It was challenging to do the whole full-stack project myself in only one week, but also allowed me to get to know all parts of the process.  

## Future improvements

Next stage of developing this website would be adding private messages functionality.
